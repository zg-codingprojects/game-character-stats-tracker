# game-character-stats-tracker

This app keeps track of a character's stats and allows modification of them, while validating specified parameters, through the use of classes and encapsulation.

## Usage

When creating a character, its name, health, mana (magic points) and level are initialised, and all these stats are displayed. There also exists the ability to change these values and for the character to level up.
